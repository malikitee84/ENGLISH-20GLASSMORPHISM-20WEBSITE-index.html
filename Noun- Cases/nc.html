    <h1>Noun Cases in English</h1>
    <div class="case">
      <div class="case-title">Nominative Case (subject case):</div>
      <p>Used for the subject of a sentence or clause.</p>
      <div class="example">Examples: "I," "he," "she," "they," "we."</div>
    </div>
    <div class="case">
      <div class="case-title">Accusative Case (objective case):</div>
      <p>
        Used for the direct object of a verb, the object of a preposition, or
        the target of an action.
      </p>
      <div class="example">Examples: "me," "him," "her," "them," "us."</div>
    </div>
    <div class="case">
      <div class="case-title">Genitive Case (possessive case):</div>
      <p>Used to indicate ownership or possession.</p>
      <div class="example">Examples: "my," "his," "her," "their," "our."</div>
    </div>
    <p>
      It's worth noting that the use of noun cases in English is generally
      limited to pronouns and possessive forms. Modern English has largely
      simplified its case system compared to older forms of the language, like
      Old English. In many cases, word order and prepositions are used to convey
      the relationships that noun cases might convey in other languages.
    </p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Nominative: "She sings a song."</li>
      <li>Accusative: "I saw him at the park."</li>
      <li>Genitive: "This is Sarah's book."</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Overall, while English does have some vestiges of noun cases, its system
      is much simpler than that of many other languages with more elaborate case
      systems.
